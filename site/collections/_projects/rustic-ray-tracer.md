This is a Rust implementation of Peter Shirley's [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) book.

This project is currently a work in progress, and is intended to be a learning experience for me to become more familiar with the Rust programming language. As such, I will be implementing the code in the book as closely as possible.
