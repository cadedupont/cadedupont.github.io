        Hello! My name is Cade DuPont and I am an undergraduate student at the University of Arkansas pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with minors in Data Analytics and Mathematics. I am expected to graduate in December 2024.<br><br>

        I am currently a teaching assistant for the <a href="https://catalog.uark.edu/search/?P=CSCE%203193" target="_blank">Programming Paradigms</a> course offered at the University of Arkansas. This course focuses on reinforcing studentsâ€™ understanding of the object-oriented programming paradigm with an introduction to functional programming. Students also gain experience working in Java, JavaScript, and Python. Responsibilities for this role include grading assignments, holding frequent office hours, and further assisting students in their comprehension of course material.<br><br>

        This is my fourth semester as a teaching assistant at the University of Arkansas Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I have also had the pleasure of being a teaching assistant for <a href="https://catalog.uark.edu/search/?P=CSCE%202004" target="_blank">Programming Foundations I</a> and <a href="https://catalog.uark.edu/search/?P=CSCE%202014" target="_blank">Programming Foundations II</a>, courses designed to teach students fundamental programming concepts, algorithms, and data structures in C++.<br><br>

        I am an incoming software engineering intern at <a href="https://tech.walmart.com/content/walmart-global-tech/en_us.html" target="_blank">Walmart Global Tech</a> for the summer of 2024.
